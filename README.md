# PyBer_Analysis

Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Overview:
The purpose of the this analysis is to compare the differences by city type and how these differences can by used by PyBer.


Results:
	
This analysis shows the following

	Followed by suburban drivers, with 625 rides, 490 drivers and a total fares amount of $19,356.33

The line plot below shows that within the time frame of Jan 2019 through Apr 2019
	- None of the line intersects which means that they are all comparable in prices depending on type of city
		- Urban being the highest in total fares has been performing between 1,500 to 2,500 range
		- Suburban has been performing between 500 and 1500 range
		- Rural has been performing between 0 to 500 range
	there was one good week in february where all 3 type spiked

Summary:
Based on these results, here are my recommendations:
	- Reevaluate the business in rural areas. Although the average cost is higher than the other two types, the money generated from these rides is not close to the amount the suburban and urban areas are generating. The company will 	need to gather more information from the rural areas to determine other reasons beside population why rural is low.
	- The amount of drivers in uban areas are more than the amount of rides that are requested. Should look deeper into the urban cities to make sure there are not drivers that are sitting idle while other cities the drivers are 	overwhelm with rides request
	- We need to gather more information on what happened in Febuary to determine what cause that spike and can it be repeated. There are also spikes every other week since February for urban types. Gathering more information on why 	that occured can help us keep the increase higher and be prepared for more drivers if needed.
